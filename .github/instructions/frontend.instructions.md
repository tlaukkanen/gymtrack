# Frontend Instructions

When making changes to the frontend codebase, please follow these guidelines to ensure consistency and maintainability:

* Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling whenever possible. This helps maintain a consistent design system across the application. Avoid using inline styles or custom CSS unless absolutely necessary. Refactor existing styles to use Tailwind classes when you encounter them.
* Ensure responsive design by utilizing Tailwind's responsive utility classes.
* Follow the existing component structure and naming conventions. If you create new components, ensure they are placed in the appropriate directories and follow the established patterns.
* Write clear and concise code with proper comments where necessary. Ensure that your code is easy to read and understand for future maintainers.
* Use React best practices, including functional components and hooks.
